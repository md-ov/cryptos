how to cut a segment S to some smaller linear segments

- if S linear then method : getCutPointsWhenLinear
find min and max point which is
    far enough from the end
    and have enough variation with the begin point


- if S not linear then method: getCutPoints
search for min and max point which is
    have enough variation with the begin point and have bigger variation with the begin point than the last point
in case not found any point
    if variation between min and max is big enough, then take it (when it is not the begin point nor the end point)

- if no cut point found, divide S to 2 sections and try to find cut point in each section
if no cut point found, divide S to 3 sections and so on
